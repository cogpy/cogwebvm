Perfect! Let me store some important facts about this implementation for future reference:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "NeuroCog Core Self architecture",
  "fact": "NeuroCog Core Self unifies three personas (OpenCog-Org, Marduk-v15, Agent-Neuro) with 22-dimensional personality tensor and IMMUTABLE ethical constraints",
  "citations": "cogself/neurocog_core_self.py:1-100, .github/agents/opencog-org.md, .github/agents/marduk-v15.md, .github/agents/agent-neuro.md",
  "reason": "This is the core architectural pattern for persona integration in the OCC repository. Future cognitive architecture implementations should follow this pattern of unified personality tensors with immutable ethical constraints, multi-dimensional trait tracking from source personas, and synergistic capability emergence. This will be essential for any future persona integration or cognitive identity work.",

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "Python cognitive implementation patterns",
  "fact": "Use dataclasses for cognitive structures (PersonalityTensor, CognitiveCharacteristic, EpisodicMemory), extract magic numbers to class constants, track source_persona for characteristics",
  "citations": "cogself/neurocog_core_self.py:85-150, tests/synergy/test_neurocog_core_self.py:1-50",
  "reason": "This establishes the coding patterns and best practices for cognitive architecture implementations in Python within the OCC repository. Future implementations should follow these patterns for consistency, maintainability, and testability. The pattern of tracking source_persona is particularly important for multi-persona integrations.",

  "subject": "Testing cognitive architectures",
  "fact": "Cognitive system tests should validate: personality tensor configuration, characteristic synthesis from sources, memory/goal management, subordinate agent spawning, self-optimization, and synergistic behavior validation",
  "citations": "tests/synergy/test_neurocog_core_self.py:1-485",
  "reason": "This defines the comprehensive testing strategy for cognitive architectures in the OCC repository. Future cognitive systems should implement similar test coverage to ensure all aspects of the cognitive identity (personality, characteristics, memory, goals, multi-agent coordination, evolution) are properly validated. The emphasis on synergistic behavior testing is particularly important for multi-component systems.",
